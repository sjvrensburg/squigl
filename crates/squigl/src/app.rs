//! The window: a live preview you drag a crop rectangle on, a zoomed view of that
//! region at native pixels, and Capture/Save. Modelled on halo-workbench's hint page:
//! aiming and pressing are one glance, the crop *is* the zoom, and what is shown is
//! always the real pixel size of what arrived.
//!
//! Everything the user sees is in *view* space: the frame turned by the chosen
//! [`Rotation`]. The crop is kept in view coordinates and mapped back to the source
//! frame only to fetch pixels ([`Crop::to_source`]).
//!
//! A block detector, when there is one, runs over the page while block mode is on --
//! at a few Hz on the live preview, once on a capture -- and lists its blocks in
//! reading order; picking one makes it the crop, and a block that is not a
//! rectangle (a curved or tilted page) is rectified before it is shown or read. The
//! crop's corners can be dragged, so a block is a starting point, not a verdict.
